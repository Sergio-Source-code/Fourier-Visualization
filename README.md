# Fourier Visualization

This website will visualize the Discrete Fourier Series which outlines any set of input coordinates. There are several commands avaiable to make the data points easier to collect.

## Usage

A point can be added with the space bar, and deleted with the backspace. Once a point is added, a red line will show where the next point is going to be added. This line has a magnitude and direction which can be changed.

## Commands

spacebar - places point \s\s
backspace - removes point \s\s
vertical arrows - changes length of red line \s\s
horizontal arrows - changes angle of red line \s\s
 \s\s
h   - makes red line point to the right (horizontal) \s\s
v   - makes red line point up (vertical) \s\s
 \s\s
f   - flips direction of red line \s\s
n/m - lowers/raises the sensitivity of arrow commands \s\s
s   - returns to standard sensitivity \s\s
p   - prints current list of data to the console \s\s
c   - toggles circle visibility \s\s
