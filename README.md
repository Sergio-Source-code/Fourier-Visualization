# Fourier Visualization

This website will visualize the Discrete Fourier Series which outlines any set of input coordinates. There are several commands avaiable to make the data points easier to collect.

## Usage

A point can be added with the space bar, and deleted with the backspace. Once a point is added, a red line will show where the next point is going to be added. This line has a magnitude and direction which can be changed.

## Commands

spacebar - places point  
backspace - removes point  
vertical arrows - changes length of red line  
horizontal arrows - changes angle of red line  
  
h   - makes red line point to the right (horizontal)  
v   - makes red line point up (vertical)  
  
f   - flips direction of red line  
n/m - lowers/raises the sensitivity of arrow commands  
s   - returns to standard sensitivity  
p   - prints current list of data to the console  
c   - toggles circle visibility
